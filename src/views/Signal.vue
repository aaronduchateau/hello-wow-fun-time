    <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
    <h3 class="maxWidth500Center">The Three Signals: <br />This time, it's different.</h3>
    <p class="maxWidth500Center">
      <br />
      Until very recently Bitcion was a dirty word in finance. For the most part, over the
      last ten years there were two specific camps. The Bitcoin wack-a-doodle fanatics,
      and the ‘smart money’ (i.e. the ‘adults / the senior advisors / the big boys’).
      Until about six months ago the ‘normals’ would rarely cross that line. Because these
      lines had been drawn so clearly, one of the key metrics that ‘Bitcoin People’ are
      always on the lookout for is news related to a change in those attitudes.
      <br /><br />
      Finance is a game of egos and reputation, and no one wants to be the guy in the room
      who suggested Bitcoin when it was simply a passing fad. Due to the ‘Network Effect’
      (i.e. the basic principles behind ‘social momentum’), it often takes several leaders
      in any given space to spawn a shift in these attitudes.
      <br /><br />
      You can suggest something is a good investment idea, and often the only thing that
      stands between people nodding and getting laughed out of the room is the reputation
      of the person from whom you got the idea.
      <br /><br />
      Three events (events I call ‘the three signals’) all occurred within the last
      several months to indicate to me that the days of Bitcoin being a fringe /
      speculative asset were numbered.

    <h3>Signal 1: Paul Tudor Jones</h3>
    <p class="maxWidth500Center">
      Paul Tudor Jones II (born September 28, 1954) is an American billionaire hedge fund
      manager, conservationist and philanthropist. In 1980, he founded his hedge fund,
      Tudor Investment Corporation, an asset management firm headquartered in Stamford,
      Connecticut. As of November 2019, Forbes Magazine estimated his net worth to be
      US$5.3 billion, making him the 343rd richest person on the Forbes 400 and the 7th
      highest-earning hedge fund manager. His financial reputation is immaculate, and he
      is generally credited with defining our modern understanding of the hedge fund. To
      this day he remains one of the most respected men in the world of finance.
      <br /><br />
      On <b>May 11th, 2020</b> Paul Tudor Jones announced he had 1% of his net worth in bitcoin.
      Almost overnight, owning bitcoin wasn't silly anymore. This all happened just a few
      short months ago, and set into motion a set of events that are snowballing into
      something much larger. <br /><br />

    <h3>This might not seem like a big deal to you, but imagine spending ten years of your life studying komodo dragons in the galapagos. <br /><br /> For the last ten years they have done the same thing everyday (eat, poop, walk, flick tongue, repeat). <br/><br/>Then one day, one of them walks up to you on it's hind legs and starts reading you quotes from 'A brief History in Time'. <br/><br/>To me (and the rest of the finance world), Paul Tudor Jones endorsing bitcion was that.  </h3>
 <br /><br /> <br /><br />
    <h3>Signal 2: Jack Dorsey</h3>
    <p class="maxWidth500Center">
      Jack Dorsey is the co-founder of Twitter, CEO of US-based payments companies
      'Square' and 'Cash App'. It is estimated that Jack Dorsey’s net worth is currently
      11.7 billion dollars. Despite unclear regulations by the SEC and receiving a ton of
      shit from the traditional finance companies, he integrated Cryptocurrency custodial
      services into Cash App in 2019, making it the first major payment platform to allow
      the purchase of cryptocurrencies. Since this decision it is estimated that (from
      Bitcoin alone) Jack Dorsey is making a Billion dollars of revenue a quarter from the
      offering.
      <br /><br />
      Then in <b>October of 2020</b>, Jack Dorsey put 1% of ‘Squares’ net worth into Bitcoin. At
      this time it was absolutely unprecedented for a publicly traded company to allocate
      50 million dollars into a speculative asset like bitcoin…

    <h3>Signal 3: Dan Schulman</h3>
    <p class="maxWidth500Center">
      Dan Schulman is the infamous tech mogul directly responsible for growing
      Priceline.com into a billion dollar company. He is currently the CEO of PayPal and
      his net worth is 180 million dollars.
      <br /><br />
      Only a few months after CashApp’s quarterly earnings became public, Paypal made
      plans to launch it's own cryptocurrency custodial service. On <b>Nov 16th, 2020</b> Paypal
      announced that its 286 million customers would be able to buy cryptocurrency through
      their primary application. That service is now live.<br /><br /><br /><br />

     <br /><br />
    <h3>After Dan Schulman, I "knew" the fundamentals were shifting. I called my mom, and told her to buy more.</h3>
    <p class="maxWidth500Center">
      <br /><br />
      It was after this point in time where I began to lose track of ‘real business’
      people taking the plunge. The network effect had begun to take hold, and just a few
      months ago, the coolest kids in the room were buying bitcoin.
      <br /><br />
      Retail investors would only notice however, when Bitcoin broke <b>20k on Dec 16th, 2020.</b>
