    <h1>Real Estate has Risk</h1>
    <h3>
      To be clear, I'm not going to trash real estate because in the long term, I think
      real estate is a good investment. Historical data associated with Real Estate
      investments is undeniable. In this climate however, I think i'm just too dumb to
      understand this market.
    </h3>
    As a shiba inu without a real estate license, much of the voodoo that transpires in
    traditioanl real estate is confusing to me. Real Estate is a complicated
    investment, that requires a lot of attention and time, and you can STILL end up upside
    down on it. <br /><br />
    If you will recall the financial collapse of 2008 was largely fueled by a term called
    ‘sub prime loans / mortgages’. The bottom line was that folks who really shouldn’t
    have been in a position to purchase homes beyond their means were allowed to do so,
    and then they were bundled, then sold, then bundled again, and then sold again, etc..
    (not to mention an extremely complicated derivates market that no one really
    understood) and *poof*....the machine stoped working.
    <br /><br />
    We (or should i say ‘THEY’), are doing all of that horrible shit again, but under the
    shroud of ARM’s (Adjustable Rate Mortgages) and ‘Noneprime mortgages’. This sets the
    stage for the same kind of thing to happen all over again. <br /><br />The frosting on the cake
    however, is that (due to Covid) we also have 4.2 MILLION delinquent mortgages are
    about to flop out (and will likely all become delinquent around the same time). Covid
    cases are going to SPIKE (not decline) as the Biden administration takes office due to
    New Years celebrations. The logistics around distributing the vaccine are time
    consuming and absurd. Bottom line, Assuming everything goes right with Vaccine
    efficacy and distribution we still have a year of horror / lockdown ahead of us.
    <br /><br />
    I don’t know what happens when you detonate a nuke inside of a nuke but I bet it’s
    crazy.
    <br /><br />
    I also, (due to my own limited expertise) do not understand how to time this event or
    ‘catch the falling knife’ in this market. I do expect that some people with large
    amounts of ‘Cash on Hand’ (people who can buy property without financing) can ‘trap’
    folks in desperate situations and run away laughing as they castrate a lifetime of
    equity from a single mom with two babies.

    <br /><br />
    Even if you had the capital on hand, the ethical considerations set aside, and the
    motivation to hunt for deals like this, you probably don’t have the time to finance,
    rehab, and flip a house in a potentially volatile market like this.
    <br /><br />
    I am looking for a place to store some nuts for the winter, not another full time job.
    <br /><br />
    Even if you do have the time to flip homes (by leveraging equity in one home to
    purchase another), you could easily end up in a ‘dominos’ scenario with the mortgage
    payments. If a few of your tenants decide to stop paying rent (which is not an
    unreasonable expectation as we enter 2021) and legislation has been put in place to
    prevent you from evicting them, the mortgage payments could tally up fast.
    <br /><br />
    For me (right now) Real Estate outside of the home I own is too complicated given
    these considerations.

    But then again, that's just my 'opinion or whatever', man,
